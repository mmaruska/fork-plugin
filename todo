* todo: activate tracing/debugging of other parts of X.
  and also here! make more levels



* left vs right hand

apa   vs  "


* time slot in the machine object


* uSE -> u {s-modifier}-e
special timing ??



* code:
**  todo:  "%lu" on 32bit!
#define TIME_FMT  ""



** make the machine a C++ object (class). with its methods?

** I need a semi-assert: assert, or just print warning.


** we should store the info on the really pressed keycode
   ... i.e. send a RawPress event


** fixme:  When we change the VT, we should release all forked stuff!
   Simply push e EOF event.


** all functions should be *.so local (static), accessible only via
   slots in exported structure!

** possible bug:
   time 0 could be a valid time?
   CurrentTime is 0.

   timeouts (per key, or global) must not be changed while we use them.



** performance enhancement:
   the 0 config could  be just  a NULL pointer. It consumes too much memory, maybe! */

** mouse stuff is run in a signal handler!
   any entry in here must  start w/  machine->lock = 1; and end w/ machine->lock = 0;

   bug: mouse (FORCE) vs replaying ..... un freeze  & reconfig i should replay even
   output_queue!




** How to check at compile time? that a #define is string (not number)?
  gcc -DVERSION 1     ... how to have it "1" ?
